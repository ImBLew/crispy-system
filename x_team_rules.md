# X-Team 10 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

Each member will volunteer on what task they want to do. Then we split the rest equally.
If a member gets stuck on one task. Then the team or part of team will work together on it.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Before starting a task. Members will create a list of subtasks that make up the task and post this list to gitHub. 
Members will cross out these subtasks as they go along ensuring an easy way to track the progress of the group. 


## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Post in the groupMe chat if you are stuck on anything for an excessive ammount of time.  
You can also get help from the TA's or the professor. 


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
 
We will meet up a week before the due date. Discusss on the progress and what 
is left or got stuck on. Then the team or part of the team will work of the problem 
together. We will maintain communication during the week before the due date to make sure
everyone is on the same page.
