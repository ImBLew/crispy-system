# X-Team 10 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

Each member will volunteer on what task they want to do. Then we split the rest equally.
If a member got stuck on one task. Then the team or part of team will work together on it.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks



## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us



## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
